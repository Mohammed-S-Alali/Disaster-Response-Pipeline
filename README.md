# Disaster Response Pipeline Project
<br>

### Project Overview
This project is completed as part of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program. The prime objective of this project is to analyze disaster data from [Figure Eight](https://www.figure-eight.com/) to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.
<br>

### Project Components
There are three components to build this project.
<br>

1. ETL Pipeline
In a Python script, `process_data.py`, a data cleaning pipeline that:
- Loads the messages and categories datasets
- Merges the two datasets
- Cleans the data
- Stores it in a SQLite database
<br>

2. ML Pipeline
In a Python script, `train_classifier.py`, a machine learning pipeline that:
- Loads data from the SQLite database
- Splits the dataset into training and test sets
- Builds a text processing and machine learning pipeline
- Trains and tunes a model using GridSearchCV
- Outputs results on the test set
- Exports the final model as a pickle file
<br>

3. Flask Web App
Flask Web App Data visualizations using Plotly in the web app.
<br>

### File Structure:
```

### Instructions:
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`
